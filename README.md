# Project 1 : Stock Watch


# User Story

We wanted to create a Web Application where beginning investors can search and compare stock prices in a clear and concise environment. We wanted to enhance the user experience by adding sections for top stocks and a currency exchange table.

We made use of 3 APIs to allow the user to search for real time stock prices and provide us with the currency exchange values. 

As a BEGINNER INVESTOR\
I WANT to be able to search for general information on stocks\
SO THAT I can keep track of the stocks I choose\
WHEN I search a stock\
THEN it is displayed so I can plainly view it and compare it with others
