# User Story
<p> We want to create a Web Application where user can check real time stock prices, check stock's history and look at predictions as well. </p>
<p> We also want them to be able buy, sell and trade stocks. </p>
<p> We will make use of 3-4 apis that will let us have the access to real time stock prices, provide us with a currency exchanger and be able to link a bank for the user so they can add funds to their portfolio account. </p>

# Technologies we plan on using 
<p> HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, JSON, api keys, Bootstrap, Toastr/Skeleton/Foundation. </p>
